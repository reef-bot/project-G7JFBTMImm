# project_folder/README.md

The README file is a guide for users and developers to understand the project structure and requirements.

Project Description:
This project aims to create a Python program that will generate a random set of numbers every 3 seconds without repeating any of the numbers. The program should also ensure that it does not use more than 500 tokens to generate the random numbers.

Improvements Needed:
- Implement a function that generates a random set of numbers and stores them in a data structure to keep track of which numbers have already been generated.
- Include a timer that triggers the generation of a new set of numbers every 3 seconds.
- Add a check to ensure that the program does not use more than 500 tokens to generate the random numbers.

Steps to Make it a Successful Project:
- Begin by creating a Python script that includes the necessary functions for generating random numbers and tracking which numbers have already been used.
- Utilize the random module in Python to generate the random numbers.
- Implement a loop that continuously generates new sets of numbers every 3 seconds.
- Include a check to ensure that each set of numbers is unique and has not been repeated.
- Set a limit of 500 tokens to be used for generating the random numbers.
- Test the program thoroughly to ensure that it functions as intended and meets all the requirements.
- Optimize the code for efficiency and readability.
- Document the code with clear comments and explanations for future reference.

Project Details:
